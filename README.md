# CV and other Latex documents

Personal details are replaced with a `---` here and where signatures are
included (typical for German applications) I didn't store the images here.

These are me and my partner's CV's and cover letters.  Feel free to adapt for
your own use, but give credit whenever publishing.

I originally took the CV template from [Akash
Benerjee](https://www.overleaf.com/articles/akash-banerjees-cv/qcxhvqqybqrq)
and adapted it for cover letter and at times for the German format.
