# Notes for the TRON application

[TRON](https://tron-mainz.de/careers/job-openings/) with
[this](https://tron-mainz.de/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Research_Scientist_Biosampling.pdf)
being the target.

## Skills to mention in cover

### SOP

Sometimes you have to work with a chryostat older than Hang and you have to
figure things out and it is good to be able to take initiative and explore what
is best suited for the task at hand.  And my PhD student seemed quite pleased
with my temperature suggestions.

### Imunocytochemistry/histochemistry

Cell proliferation during development chickens using immunohistochemistry

Fluorescent indirect immunocytochemistry to assess retinoic acid treatment on lateral
sclerosis
([here](https://github.com/SonkeWohler/didiEssays/blob/master/BM4010Lab/main.tex))

DNA extraction.

### Model Organisms

Xenopus, everything that didn't require licensing at the time.

* egg fertilisation (from scratch)
* treatment (working with solutions)
* observing axis malformation

Mouse in Honours Project

* various staining methods
* professional research notebook
* SOP
* the MASTER of in situ hybridysation
  - vibratome and chryostat
  - mounting
* BCIP-NBT colour reaction
* microscope
  - Nikon SMZ 1500
  - Zeiss DXM 1200 (fluorescent)
* in vitro transcription
* electrophoresis
* exposure unrelated experiments
  - explants
    - ImageJ
    - Zeiss microscope
    - PRISM for ANOVA analysis
  - chicken
* I liked being active in the lab.  I liked using my free time in the lab
  observing other people's experiments and learning from them.  At times they
  were willing to teach me for example to harvest chicken samples.

Mouse Motor-Neuron Cultures

* 

Yeast

* observe some genetic changes
* cultured on agar

E.Coli

* cloning and propagation of restriction fragments of bacteriofage lambda in
  escherichia coli using the plasmid vector pBR322
* small scale DNA manipulation under DNA-ase free condition
* simple cloning (restriction digestion of DNA, ligation, transformation,
  selection of transformants and agarose gel electrophoresis)
* isolate and analyse plasmid DNA from E.Coli (restriction mapping)

Chicken

* Immunohistochemistry


## skils required

* microscope plus fluorescence
* preparation
  - in situ hybridisation
  - fluorescent immunocytochemistry and also histochemistry
* analysis
  - microscope (plus fluorescent)
    - mounting (favorite part because dexterity)
    - imageJ
  - Uni Reports (total of 5)
  - vibratome + chryostating
* record keeping (+SOP)
  - lab book
  - ECDL
* independent working manner
* histology (passion and dexterity)
* independence wherever capable
* biospecimen processing (xenopus, nurse training, honours...)
