  Dear Ms Sandra Nauth, \\
  Dear TRON,

%%% Statement Suggested
%%% ------------------------------------------------------------
  \sepspace
  
  \noindent
  I am writing in reference to an open position as a Researcher in
  Biosampling.  Your company caught my interest while I was researching career
  opportunities in the region as a I am planning to relocate to Germany.  I
  recently graduated with a degree in Human Embryology and Developmental
  Biology and I am looking for the best way to further expand my knowledge and
  skills *while providing the employer with the best of didi at the same damn
  time.  The Researcher for Biosampling position caught my interest as I am
  accustomed with the responsibilities and would be a smooth way of depending
  my knowledge.

  \noindent 
  After starting nursing school I became more interested in research and
  developmental biology.  I loved the practical <aspects of the medical work>,
  but wanted more profound knowledge so I moved on to an opportunity at one of the
  best universities for Biomedical Sciences in the UK.  This program was suited
  for me as the university had weekly wet laboratory sessions, which were
  followed by data analysis and reporting.  Some of the relevant techniques
  applied were**.  For my honours project I worked on the development of the
  optic pathways by factors secreted by the meninges, which basically meant I
  was in charge of the lab experiments (of myself?) while left unsupervised and
  because I was doing such a great job I was allowed to participate and help
  with extra experiments.  Off lab skills acquired include microscope stuff,
  including fluorescent, Photoshop, prism for data analysis, ImageJ, results
  processing and analysation.  It was during this project that I developed an
  interest for Histology as it was recommended to me as a future field of work
  due to my dexterity while working with fragile samples.
  \sepspace

  \noindent 
  TRON in Mainz would not only allow me to enter Germany, where I would like to
  live for the foreseeable future *with personal ties there*.  You would also
  provide me with opportunities to grow and experiment with new skills and
  research, *a place to apply my brain properly*.  I have enjoyed working with
  my supervising PhD student to improve the <standard operating> protocols
  (SOP) in place in Dr. Erskine's Laboratory in Aberdeen in the past, and will
  be looking forward to doing this on a larger scale at TRON.  My favorite part
  of the lab work was mounting the samples onto the slides and making sure that
  they were laid out perfectly without folds or any piece of dust.  Removing
  such particles from the sample was exceptionally pleasant to me as it gave me
  the opportunity to practice my dexterity.  I would love to have the chance to
  apply my skills and have the opportunity to learn new ones in a company as
  connected as TRON.
  \sepspace

  % company as connected as TRON is something we can elaborate to BioNTech,
  % with multiple members having worked there and the founders of TRON were
  % honoured for their work at BioNTech; and we can connect it to the
  % universities in Mainz.

  \noindent
  Looking forward to hearing from you, \\\\
  Kindest Regards,\\
  Diana Andreea Judea

  PS. As mentioned in out conversation, I am not fluent in German, especially
  in spoken.  Currently my proficiency is at B1 level, lower than it used to be
  before I studied in the UK.  In written German I am more confident, so I feel
  that correspondence with the ethics committee would not be a problem for me,
  especially long term.
