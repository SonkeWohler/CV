  Dear Ms Sandra Nauth, \\
  Dear TRON,
  
%%% Statment

  \noindent
  I am writting in reference to an open position as a \href{https://tron-mainz.de/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Research_Scientist_Biosampling.pdf}{Researcher in Biosampling} as advertised on your website.
  \sepspace
  
  \noindent
  I started my professional education in nursing school, but wasn't for me because not enough science, depth, dexterity.  Hence moved on to opportunity at one of the best universities for Biomedical in the UK.
  \sepspace

  \noindent
  Courses and subjects at uni and relevant in Honours.  Mouse Model, Translation, Lab Work and Data Analysis was an important part of the degree. \\
  \sepspace
  
  \noindent
  I acquired complete fluency in English there, but German I am B1 self assessed, used to be B2 before studying in the UK.  Aiming to become more fluent in Germany at every opportunity.  Much more confident in written language.
  \sepspace

  \noindent
  Laboratory Responsibilities: \\
  Cryostating (old manual model) (better temperature), Vibratome, Solution Prep, cleanup and setup (where technically allowed and a little beyond), microscope (+fluorescent, self setup), Image Analysis (imageJ?), probe prep, electrophoresis \\
  Focus on how quickly I picked things up and how much I had to figure things out myself. \\
  Difficult with malfunctioning equipment?  Exceptionally good slides.

    I would like to apply to the Embryogy Laboratory Technician position, advertised for the In-Vitro Fertilisation Clinic, reference number \textbf{ARU011T}. I have just completed my third year at the University of Aberdeen in a BSc (Hons) of Human Embryology and Developmental Biology and I believe this is the right time to gain more professional experience related to my degree, before going into my fourth year.

    \noindent
    The University of Aberdeen, as a whole and its IVF clinic specifically, have historically been at the cutting edge of scientific advancement and patient care, attempting to use its status in one to benefit the other. For myself, rather than simply being close to where I study, this is perhaps one of the most ideal environments to achieve a professional level in my skills, and perhaps grow further to eventually contribute on a higher level.
    \sepspace

    \noindent
    As a student of Human Embryology, laboratory procedures, like pipetting, preparing ELISAs, in vitro fertilisation of model organisms and maintaining cell cultures, are core skills for my degree. More than this, these are the aspects that I enjoy the most and wish to expand on as much as possible, beyond what the university can offer me. So far I have learnt to be precise and reliable in my nursing training, performing injections, taking blood and monitoring patient vitals on a daily basis. In the laboratory these skills based on focus and precision have proven to be essential for productive results, which in turn aided my understanding of the subjects and my ability to draw meaningful conclusions.
    \sepspace

    \noindent
    I believe, while I certainly lack professional experience, I am a capable laboratory worker with a good education and high learning motivation. This would be a great opportunity for me, and I believe I could clearly benefit the IVF team.
