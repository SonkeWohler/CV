  Dear Ms Sandra Nauth, \\
  Dear TRON,

%%% Statement
%%% ------------------------------------------------------------
  \sepspace 

  \noindent Following our email conversation I am following up with the
  application for the position of Researcher in Biosampling.  As I am planning
  to relocate to Germany I was researching career opportunities in the area and
  TRON and the Researcher in Biosampling position caught my interest as I
  believe that it will allow me to grow while at the same time providing my
  employer with excellent laboratory skills, dedication, accuracy and passion
  for histology.  I recently graduated with a degree in Human Embryology and
  Developmental Biology and I am looking for the best way to further expand my
  knowledge and expertise towards histology.

  \sepspace 

  \noindent My passion for medical sciences started while I was in nursing
  school.  I found myself to be very fascinated about the practical side of the
  job but felt like I was lacking stimulation in the theoretical area.  I
  wanted to deepen my knowledge so after I completed the 3 months of practice
  required to finish the first year, I moved to study to one of the best
  universities for Biomedical Sciences in the UK.  The program suited my
  expectations by having wet laboratory sessions almost weekly.  The sessions
  were built to increase the students independence from supervision and
  guidance and were followed by data analysis and report writing.  In the final
  3 month project we were expected to work fully autonomously in the laboratory
  and keep a Research Notebook.  During worktime I liked observing other
  peopleâ€™s experiments and when there was time some would be happy to talk to
  me about their projects and even teach me some skills, for example
  collecting chicken embryo tissue.  I was working on mouse model organism
  with a PhD student who after observing the way I was conducting myself
  allowed me to handle some unrelated experiments for her while she was not
  around.  During this project I impressed with particularly skillfully
  mounted slides and other dexterous tasks.

  \sepspace 
  \noindent It was this dexterity that lead me looking for opportunities to
  work in Histology in the region I would like to live in for the foreseeable
  future.  TRON in Mainz stands out as a well connected company, even to the
  now rather famous BioNtech.  While I have enjoyed taking initiative in
  helping my peers when supervisors were busy and optimising the chryostat
  temperature in Aberdeen, I am looking to do more than just perfect my skills
  and my samples, I want to deepen my knowledge and help deepen our
  understanding.  

  \sepspace

  \noindent In short, after entering this pandemic as a student, I am looking
  forward to end it as a scientist in Mainz.  Hence I am looking forward to
  hearing from you.
  \sepspace

  \noindent
  Kindest Regards,\\
  Diana Andreea Judea
