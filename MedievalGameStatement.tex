%%% Statement
%%% ------------------------------------------------------------
  \sepspace
  
  \noindent
  I would like to apply to participate in the \textit{Playing in the Archives} Project as a game developer, specifically to the post advertised by Prof. Vasconcelos for a student of computing at the University of Aberdeen. 
  \sepspace
  
  \noindent
  When reading about the post, I must say, it was disappointing to think I would already be preoccupied with a full time position at the University for the Oil and Gas Industry. Thus far I have not been able to explore my interest in game development and the \textit{Playing in the Archives} project would be ideal in two ways; so much so that I would greatly regret not spending some of my free time and holiday on it.

  On the one hand

  \noindent
  I can draw on now 20 years of user experience, beginning with children's games and gradually focusing on historical strategy games for the most part. \\
  \textit{[Stronghold, Mount and Blade, The Settlers]} \\
  Learning to program put a completely new lens on my gaming experiences and made me more involved in the development stories of my favourite games. This led me towards a more professional understanding of how these games work under the hood which I hope will make up for some of my lacking experience specific to game development.

  \noindent  
  \textit{[Historic Interest with Historical Fencing.]} \\
  \textit{[Not at all specific to the medieval period, with my fencing focused on highland broadsword and some of my researach as well, but again my interest is not specific.]} \\
  \textit{[fencing started with Japanese Swordsmanship (from Iaid$\bar o$ towards Kendjiutsu) from which I discovered Historical European Swordsmanship (HEMA)]}
