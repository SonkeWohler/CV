  Dear Dr Elizabeth Ferguson, \\

%%% Statement

    \noindent
    I would like to apply to the Embryoogy Laboratory Technician position advertised for the In-vitro Fertilisation Clinic, reference number \textbf{ARU011T}. I have just completed my third year at the University of Aberdeen in a BSc (Hons) of Human Embryology and Developmental Biology and I believe this is the right time to gain more professional experience related to my degree, before going into my fourth year.

    As a student of Human Embryology, laboratory procedures, like pipetting, preparing ELISAs, in vitro fertilisation of model organisms and maintaining cell cultures, are core skills for my degree. More than this, these are the aspects that I enjoy the most and wish to expand on as much as possible, beyond what university can offer me. So far I have learnt to be precise and reliable in my nursing training, performing injections, taking bloods and monitoring patient vitals on a daily basis. In the laboratory these skills based on focus and precision proved essential for productive results, which in turn aided my understanding of the subjects and my ability to draw meaningful conclusions.
